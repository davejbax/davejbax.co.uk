## Portfolio

Here's some of the stuff that I've done over the years.

### LetMePass

LetMePass is a **password manager** for Android, developed as part of my A-Level
computer science coursework. The app features strong cryptography *(AES-256 w/ GCM, Argon2)*,
Google Drive cloud-sync, and password [breach checking](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords).
It is also fully free and [open source](https://github.com/davejbax/letmepass).

### Advent of Code

Okay, this isn't really a portfolio item, but I couldn't resist mentioning it because it was so much fun.

In recent years, I got bored of doing the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in so-called 'sensible' languages.
So, in 2022, I decided to do it in [Google Sheets](https://github.com/davejbax/adventofcode2022) &mdash; without macros or anything fancier than a
few formulas. I had to stop on day 7, by which point I had started writing a compiler that would generate an Excel
spreadsheet from a sort of pseudocode, when I realised that it had been a while since I'd been outside.

In 2023, I tried to use [Terraform](https://github.com/davejbax/adventofcode2023). It may surprise you to know that
this actually wasn't much easier than Google Sheets, and I unfortunately only made it as far as day 5 before my free
time started to be eroded.

In 2024, I <del>ran out of ideas</del> decided to take a break. Watch this space to see what I'll cook up for 2025.

### DefianceCraft

DefianceCraft was an [award-winning](https://www.planetminecraft.com/blog/the-planet-awards-category-servers/) **Minecraft** server
that I operated with a colleague from 2011-2017.
I developed an array of **bespoke software** to run on the server and provide
unique features to players, boosting server popularity and revenue, and distinguishing DefianceCraft
from the competition.

To support the **hundreds of thousands** of unique players, I developed software (in Java);
websites, using a variety of technologies; and server-side bash scripts. I also dabbled in
protocol analysis (to support new game features before official APIs became available).

Some of the project's more recent codebase can be viewed on [Github](https://github.com/defiancecraft).

### Why The Mood?

![Why The Mood?](/assets/img/whythemood.png){:class="img-small"}

[Why The Mood?](https://whythemood.000webhostapp.com/) is a project I co-developed in 2019 for **ManMetHacks 1.0** (a 24-hour hackathon).
It is a wellbeing questionnaire, aiming to provide tips to improve health and wellbeing when the exact issues are harder to identfy.
