## Portfolio

Here's some of the stuff that I've done over the years.

### LetMePass

LetMePass is a **password manager** for Android, developed as part of my A-Level
computer science coursework. The app features strong cryptography *(AES-256 w/ GCM, Argon2)*,
Google Drive cloud-sync, and password [breach checking](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords).
It is also fully free and [open source](https://github.com/davejbax/letmepass).

### DefianceCraft

DefianceCraft was an [award-winning](https://www.planetminecraft.com/blog/the-planet-awards-category-servers/) **Minecraft** server
that I operated with a colleague from 2011-2017.
I developed an array of **bespoke software** to run on the server and provide
unique features to players, boosting server popularity and revenue, and distinguishing DefianceCraft
from the competition.

To support the **hundreds of thousands** of unique players, I developed software (in Java);
websites, using a variety of technologies; and server-side bash scripts. I also dabbled in
protocol analysis (to support new game features before official APIs became available).

Some of the project's more recent codebase can be viewed on [Github](https://github.com/defiancecraft).

### Why The Mood?

[Why The Mood?](https://whythemood.000webhostapp.com/) is a project I co-developed in 2019 for **ManMetHacks 1.0** (a 24-hour hackathon).
It is a wellbeing questionnaire, aiming to provide tips to improve health and wellbeing when the exact issues are harder to identfy.
