## Portfolio

Here's some of the stuff that I've done over the years.

### DefianceCraft

DefianceCraft was a <strong>Minecraft</strong> server that I operated with a colleague from 2012-2017.
I developed an array of <strong>bespoke software</strong> to run on the server and provide
unique features to players, boosting server popularity and revenue, and distinguishing DefianceCraft
from the competition.
