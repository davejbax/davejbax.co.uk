## About

I'm a 20-something-year-old living in Manchester, UK. I graduated from the **University of Manchester** in 2022 with a BSc in Computer Science with Industrial Experience. Since then, I've been lucky enough to pursue a career in something I love: tinkering with tech!

Outside of the digital world, I enjoy climbing fake rocks, playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons, cooking, and playing guitar. You can probably find me in the local bouldering gym staring bewilderedly at a V3 (or alternatively, [drop me an email]({% link contact.md %}) if you'd like to chat).
