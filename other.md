## Other stuff

This page is dedicated to everything I do outside of computer science.

### Music

I make awful music, sometimes! I don't yet have any tracks that I'm confident enough to release to the world, but hopefully some will appear here one day. I also play electric guitar.

### Photography

I take photos of things &mdash; mainly landscapes and urban cities. You can find all of these on my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/davejbax).
