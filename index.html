  Hi! I'm Dave, a <strong>software engineer</strong> 👩‍💻 and <strong>coffee enthusiast</strong> ☕
  based in Manchester, UK.
</p>
<p>
  I like writing software to solve cool problems, learning about all things tech,
  and diving into a challenge head-first. A snapshot of some of that is available
  on the <a href="{% link portfolio.md %}">portfolio page</a>, or there's even more on my
  <a href="https://github.com/davejbax">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Currently, I'm working in the cybercrime disruption industry writing software in a Platform Engineering team.
  I'm interested in <strong>Go</strong>, <strong>Kubernetes</strong>, and systems architecture when processing
  data at <strong>scale</strong>.
